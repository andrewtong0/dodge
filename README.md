# ip_dodge
A simple phone game where you need to dodge through gaps in oncoming walls

I had some issues with the .exe/.apk exports as my antivirus would quarantine the file. If you experience the same issue and would still like to view the project, I encourage you to check out my short YouTube video on it here:

## Controls
.exe version
- Click to move your square in one of the four coloured lanes
- Alternatively use ASDF to move into the corresponding lane

.apk version
- Tap on the lane to jump to it

## Objective
Survive as long as you can! The game progressively gets harder as your score increases! Generally, every 10 points either the wall speed or spawn rate increases, but sometimes it's every 15 or 20 when it gets really fast. It eventually caps out in the 100+ score region and doesn't get any faster.
